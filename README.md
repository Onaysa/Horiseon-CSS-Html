# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

Deployed Application : (https://onaysa.github.io/Horiseon-CSS-Html/)

## Description
 A simple webpage with images, icons and a header. It gives easy accessiblity and the heading falls in a sequential order.

- Why did you build this project? 
I built this project to give me a little more understanding on how to use "nav" on html to give the clean header section,and on how link images on html and css as well. I have also learnt on how to push my changes on to github and be able to see them their.
